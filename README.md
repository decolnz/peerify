peerify
=======

Perl Script to lookup the Peering DB and auto-generate peer config

We assume you have a local copy of the peeringDB running on a MySQL server (The Dump is available here: www.peeringdb.com/dbexport/peeringdb.sql ).

Script still in development (ie: it's still rough). 

Output is JunOS (For now). Might add other platforms at another time. 

Usage:

[code]
./peerify ASN
[/code]
